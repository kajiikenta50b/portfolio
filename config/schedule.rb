# It's helpful, but not entirely necessary to understand cron before proceeding.

# Example:
#
#一旦コメントアウト
#set :output, "log/cron_log.log"
#set :environment, "production" # 必要に応じて"development/production"に変更
#
#every :monday, at: '12am' do
#  rake "faction_rank:calculate_top"
#end
#
# every 4.days do
#   runner "AnotherModel.prune_old_records"
